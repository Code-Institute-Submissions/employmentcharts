# readMe - Irelandâ€™s Employment Distribution

## The Idea
The Idea was that I would take the data from the Irish government and visualise the distribution and changes in employment in Ireland in various sectors over the last few years.

## Features
A bar graph that shows the distribution of employment among 9 sectors in Ireland as defined by the Irish government.

Change between stats for full-time and part-time employees through the dropdown selection menu.
